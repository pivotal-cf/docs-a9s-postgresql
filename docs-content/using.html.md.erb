# Using the PostgreSQL

This topic describes how to use PostgreSQL.


## <a id='use-a9s-postgresql-with-an-application'></a> Use PostgreSQL with an App

To use the PostgreSQL with with an app, follow the procedures in this section to create a service instance and bind the service instance to your app. For more information on managing service instances, see [Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html).

### <a id='view-the-a9s-postgresql-service'></a> View the PostgreSQL Service

After the service is installed, `a9s-postgresql` and its service plans appear in your CF marketplace. Run `cf marketplace` to see the service listing:

```bash
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org test / space test as admin...
OK

service            plans                                                                                              description
a9s-postgresql04     postgresql-single-small, postgresql-cluster-small, postgresql-single-big, postgresql-cluster-big   This is the PostgreSQL 9.4 service.
```

See the next section for instructions on creating a9s PostgreSQL service instances based on the plans listed in the `cf marketplace` output.

### <a id='create-a-service-instance'></a> Create a Service Instance

To provision a Posa9s PostgreSQLtgreSQL database, run `cf create-service`. For example:

```bash
$ cf create-service a9s-postgresql postgresql-single-small my-postgresql-service
```

Depending on your infrastructure and service broker usage, it may take several minutes to create the service instance.

Check the creation status using `cf services`. This displays a list of all your service instances. To check the status of a specific service instance, run `cf service NAME-OF-YOUR-SERVICE`.

### <a id='bind-an-application-to-a-service-instance'></a> Bind an Application to a Service Instance

After you create your database, run `cf bind-service` to bind the service to your application:

```bash
$ cf bind-service a9s-postgresql-app my-postgresql-service
```

### <a id='estage-or-restart-your-application'></a> Restage or Restart Your Application

To enable your app to access the service instance, run `cf restage` or `cf restart` to restage or restart your app.

### <a id='obtain-service-instance-access-credentials'></a> Obtain Service Instance Access Credentials

After a service instance is bound to an application, the credentials of your a9s PostgreSQL database are stored in the environment variables of the application. Run `cf env APP-NAME` to display the environment variables.

You can find the credentials in the [VCAP_SERVICES](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) key.

```bash
$ cf env a9s-postgresql-app
Getting env variables for app a9s-postgresql-app in org test / space test as admin...
OK

System-Provided:
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "a9s-postgresql": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "host": "EXAMPLE-HOST",
     "hosts": ["EXAMPLE-HOST"],
     "name": "d92e2bd",
     "password": "EXAMPLE-PASSWORD",
     "port": 5432,
     "uri": "EXAMPLE-URI",
     "username": "EXAMPLE-USERNAME"
    },
    "label": "a9s-postgresql",
    "name": "my-postgresql-service",
    "plan": "postgresql-cluster-small",
    "tags": [
     "sql",
     "database"
    ]
   }
  ]
 }
}
...
```

You can use the host, username and password values to connect to your database with a a9s PostgreSQL client.


## <a id='delete-an-a9s-postgresql-service-instance'></a> Delete an PostgreSQL Service Instance

<p class='note warning'></a><strong>WARNING:</strong> Before deleting a service instance, you must back up data stored in your database. This operation cannot be undone and all the data is lost when the service is deleted.</p>

Before you can delete a service instance, you must unbind it from all apps.

### <a id='list-available-services'></a> List Available Services

Run `cf services` to list your available services.

```bash
$ cf services

Getting services in org test / space test as admin...
OK

name                    service          plan                      bound apps           last operation
my-postgresql-service   a9s-postgresql   postgresql-single-small   a9s-postgresql-app   create succeeded
```

This example shows that `my-postgresql-service` is bound to the `a9s-postgresql-app` app.

### <a id='unbind-a-service-instance'></a> Unbind a Service Instance

Run `cf unbind` to unbind the service from your app.

```bash
$ cf unbind-service a9s-postgresql-app my-postgresql-service
```

### <a id='delete-a-service-instance'></a> Delete a Service Instance

After unbinding the service, it is no longer bound to an application. Run `cf delete-service` to delete the service:

```bash
  $ cf delete-service my-postgresql-service
```

It may take several minutes to delete the service. Deleting a service deprovisions the corresponding infrastructure resources.
Run the `cf services` command to view the deletion status.


# <a id='upgrade-the-service-instance-to-another-service-plan'></a> Upgrade the Service Instance to another Service Plan

Once created, you can upgrade your service instance to another, larger service plan. A larger service plan provides more CPU, RAM, and storage. For more information, see the  [Update a Service Instance](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#update_service) of the _Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI_ topic.

```bash
$ cf update-service my-postgresql-service -p a-bigger-plan
```

Here are the plans you can upgrade to depending on the one you are currently using:

* If you are currently using the `postgresql-single-small` plan, you can upgrade to the `postgresql-single-big` plan.

* If you are currently using the `postgresql-cluster-small` plan, you can upgrade to the `postgresql-cluster-big` plan.


## <a id='add-a-graphite-endpoint'></a> Add a Graphite Endpoint

If you want to monitor your service with Graphite, you can set an endpoint to where to information will be sent with the `cf update-service` command. This command expects the [-c flag](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#arbitrary-params-binding) and a JSON string containing the `graphite` and `metrics_prefix` keys.
Depending on your graphite provider, the `metrics_prefix` might require that each metrics must start with an API key in their name. You can also change the interval within the data is send to the endpoint. To do this, modify `interval`; the default is 10s.

```bash
$ cf update-service my-postgresql-service -c '{ "graphite": ["yourspace.your-graphite-endpoint.com:12345"], "metrics_prefix": "your-api-key.my-cluster-postgresql", "interval": "5"}'
```


## <a id='add-a-syslog-endpoint'></a> Add a Syslog Endpoint

The `cf update-service` command used with the [-c flag](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#arbitrary-params-binding) can let you stream your syslog to a third-party service. In this case, the command expects a JSON string containing the `syslog` key. You can also change the interval for the syslog with the same key than for the graphite endpoint `interval`.

```bash
$ cf update-service my-postgresql-service -c '{ "syslog": ["logs4.your-syslog-endpoint.com:54321"], "interval": "5" }'
```


## <a id='cloud-foundry-application-security-groups'></a> Cloud Foundry Application Security Groups

This topic describes how to check whether a security group was created.

Each a9s Data Service will automatically create and update Cloud Foundry security groups in order to protected service instances to be accessed by applications not running in the same Cloud Foundry applications space.
To get a better understanding about Security Groups, see [Understanding Application Security Groups](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/asg.html).

### <a id='get-service-instance-guid'></a> Get Service Instance GUID

To get the GUID of the service instance, run `cf service INSTANCE_NAME --guid`.

```bash
$ cf service my-postgresql --guid
ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028
```

### <a id='check-available-security-groups'></a> Check Available Security Groups

To see all available security groups, run `cf security-groups`.

```
$cf security-groups
Getting security groups as demo@anynines.com
OK

     Name                                         Organization     Space
#0   public_networks
#1   dns
#2   tcp_open
#3   guard_432fb752-876d-443b-a311-a075f4df2237   demonstrations   demo
#4   guard_ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028   demonstrations   demo
```

You can see a security group with the named `guard_ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028` was successfully created.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> In some circumstances, the connection between the application and the service instance is not possible. In this case, check to see if a security group was created.</p>


## <a id='backup-and-restore-service-instances'></a> Back Up and Restore Service Instances

PostgreSQL provides an easy way to create backups and restore if needed.

### <a id='get-dashboard-address-login-and-authorize'></a> Get Dashboard Address, Log In, and Authorize

1. Grap the dashboard URL with `cf service SERVICE-NAME`.
  ```bash
  $cf service my-postgresql

  Service instance: my-postgresql
  Service: a9s-postgresql
  Bound apps:
  Tags:
  Plan: postgresql-single-small
  Description: This is a service creating and managing dedicated a9s PostgreSQL service instances and clusters, powered by the anynines Service Framework
  Documentation url:
  Dashboard: https://a9s-postgresql-dashboard.aws.ie.a9s.eu/service-instances/ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on the size of the data, the restore will take some time.</p>

![service-dashboard](images/service-dashboard-final.png)


## <a id='make-a-service-instance-locally-available'></a> Make a Service Instance Locally Available

It is possible to access any of the a9s Data Services locally. You can connect with a local client to the service for any purpose, such as debugging.
CF provides a smart way to create SSH forward tunnels through a pushed application.
For more information about this feature, see the [Accessing Apps with SSH](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html) section of the CF documentation.

First, you must have an application bound to the service. To do this, see [Bind an Application to a Service Instance](#bind-an-application-to-a-service-instance).

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> `cf ssh` support must be enabled in the platform. Your administrator can tell you whether it is enabled.</p>

### <a id='get-the-service-url-and-credentials'></a> Get the Service URL and Credentials

You must first follow the procedure in [Obtain Service Instance Access Credentials](#obtain-service-instance-access-credentials) to get the hostname of the service and the user credentials.

```bash
$ cf env a9s-postgresql-app
Getting env variables for app a9s-postgresql-app in org test / space test as admin...
OK

System-Provided:
{
  "VCAP_SERVICES": {
   "a9s-postgresql": [
    {
      "credentials": {
       "host": "d67901c-psql-master-alias.node.dc1.consul",
       "hosts": [
        "d67901c-pg-0.node.dc1.consul",
        "d67901c-pg-1.node.dc1.consul",
        "d67901c-pg-2.node.dc1.consul"
       ],
       "password": "a9s-brk-usr",
       "username": "a9s-password"
     },
     "label": "a9s-postgresql",
     "name": "my-postgresql-service",
     "plan": "postgresql-cluster-small"
    }
   ]
  }
}
...
```

Note the host `d67901c-psql-master-alias.node.dc1.consul`, the username `a9s-brk-usr`, and the password `a9s-password`. You will need this in the next step.

### <a id='create-a-tunnel-to-the-service'></a> Create a Tunnel to the Service

With `cf ssh`,  you can create am SSH forward tunnel to the management dashboard.
Use port `5432` to connect to the PostgreSQL Instance.

```bash
$ cf ssh a9s-postgresql-app -L 5432:d67901c-psql-master-alias.node.dc1.consul:5432
vcap@956aaf4e-6da9-4f69-4b1d-8e631a403312:~$
```

When the SSH tunnel is open, you can access the instance using the address `localhost:5432`.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to close the session with <code>exit</code>.</p>


## <a id='postgresql-extensions'></a> a9s PostgreSQL Extensions

### <a id='postgresql-custom-parameters'></a> Create or Drop Extensions

To install a9s PostgreSQL extensions with the Cloud Foundry CLI and additional configuration parameters, run the following commands:

```bash
$ cf create-service a9s-postgresql PLAN_NAME INSTANCE_NAME -c '{"install_plugins": ["<plugin_name>"]}'
$ cf update-service INSTANCE_NAME -c '{"install_plugins": ["<plugin_name>]}'
$ cf update-service INSTANCE_NAME -c '{"delete_plugins": ["<plugin_name>]}'
```

#### <a id='available-extenstions'></a> Available Extensions

The following a9s PostgreSQL extensions are available:

* postgis
* uuid-ossp
* ltree
* pgcrypto
* citext

#### <a id='default-extensions'></a> Default Extensions

Some a9s PostgreSQL extensions are always installed and cannot be deleted. The following a9s PostgreSQL extensions are set as default extensions:

* pgcrypto
* citext

These two extensions are necessary for a functional replication.


## <a id='a9s-postgresql-custom-parameters'></a> a9s PostgreSQL Custom Parameters

As an end user, you have the ability to customize your service instance by using custom parameters.
Custom parameters are passed on to a service instance by using the `-c` switch of the cf CLI commands `cf create-service`
and `cf update-service`. For example, running `cf update-service mypg -c '{"max_connections": "100"}'` would set the maximum number of concurrent connections to 100 for the service instance `mypg`.

You are not required to utilize these settings.

Every parameter corresponds to a property in the configuration file for the respective a9s PostgreSQL version.

### <a id='max_connections'></a> max_connections

Determines the [maximum number of concurrent connections](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-connection.html) to the database server.

The default in the service plan of an anynines deployment is as follows:

| Plan  | Max Connections   |
|-------|:-----------------:|
| big   | 100               |
| small | 50                |
| nano  | 20                |

An integer value greater than 10 is expected.

### <a id='effective_cache_size'></a> effective_cache_size

[Sets the planner's assumption about the effective size of the disk cache that is available to a single query.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-CACHE-SIZE)

<p class='note'></a> Our BOSH release includes an algorithm that calculates a usable value for this property on the fly based on the resources of the VM running.</p>

The `effective_cache_size` property can be specified (e.g. '2GB') or omitted. If `effective_cache_size` is not set, its value is 75% of the total memory.
If the total memory is less than 4&nbsp;GB, it will use 50% of the total memory with a floor of 256&nbsp;MB. When specifying this value, make sure you set a value that leads to a configuration that is higher than `shared_buffers`, because shared buffers are included in the a9s PostgreSQL query execution planner.

An integer value greater than 0 is expected.

### <a id='shared_buffers'></a> shared_buffers

[Sets the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-resource.html)

The `property shared_buffers` can be specified (e.g. '2048MB') or omitted. If `shared_buffers` is not set, its value is 25% of the total memory, if the total memory is greater than 1&nbsp;GB and 15% or less with a floor of 128&nbsp;MB.

An integer value greater than 0 is expected.

### <a id='work_mem'></a> work_mem

[Specifies the amount of memory to be used by internal sort operations and hash tables before writing to temporary disk files.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-resource.html)

An integer value greater than 0 is expected. The default is 8&nbsp;MB for anynines deployment plans.

### <a id='temp_file_limit'></a> temp_file_limit

[Specifies the maximum amount of disk space that a process can use for temporary files, such as sort and hash temporary files, or the storage file for a held cursor.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-resource.html)

An integer value greater than 0 is expected. Alternatively, "-1" means "no limit". The default value is "-1".


## <a id='create-a-fork-of-a-service-instance'></a> Create a Fork of a Service Instance

Forking a service instance involves creating a backup of a service instance, modifying the backup, and restoring it to a different service instance.

1. Ensure you have two service instances:
```shell
$ cf s
Getting services in org my_org / space my_space as user@domain.com...

name    service            plan                       bound apps   last operation
psql1   a9s-postgresql94   postgresql-replica-small                create succeeded
psql2   a9s-postgresql94   postgresql-replica-small                create succeeded
```

1. Create a service key for each service instance by running `cf create-service-key psql1 mykey`. You can then look at the key's contents:
```shell
$ cf service-key psql1 mykey
Getting key mykey for service instance psql1 as user@domain.com...

{
 "host": "pcsd85301a-psql-master-alias.node.dc1.consul",
 "hosts": [
  "pcsd85301a-pg-0.node.dc1.consul",
  "pcsd85301a-pg-1.node.dc1.consul",
  "pcsd85301a-pg-2.node.dc1.consul"
 ],
 "name": "pcsd85301a",
 "password": "a9spass",
 "port": 5432,
 "uri": "postgres://a9suser:a9spass@pcsd85301a-psql-master-alias.node.dc1.consul:5432/pcsd85301a",
 "username": "a9suser"
}
$ cf service-key psql2 mykey
Getting key mykey for service instance psql2 as user@domain.com...

{
 "host": "pcsd59c00c-psql-master-alias.node.dc1.consul",
 "hosts": [
  "pcsd59c00c-pg-0.node.dc1.consul",
  "pcsd59c00c-pg-0.node.dc1.consul",
  "pcsd59c00c-pg-0.node.dc1.consul"
 ],
 "name": "pcsd59c00c",
 "password": "a9spass",
 "port": 5432,
 "uri": "postgres://a9suser:a9spass@pcsd59c00c-psql-master-alias.node.dc1.consul:5432/pcsd59c00c",
 "username": "a9suser"
}
```
You need the database names for later use, as well as the credentials for `psql2`. The database name is the trailing part of the URI. For `psql1`, the database name is `pcsd85301a`. For `psql2`, the database name is `pcsd59c00c`.
Additional prerequisites regarding command line tools:
- BASH (some shell)
- cat
- sed
- openssl
- psql (the command line client for psql)

1. Open the service dashboard of the service instance you want to fork, as in the `psql1` example. You can find the dashboard URL by running the following command:
```shell
$ cf service psql1
Showing info of service psql1 in org my_org / space my_space as user@domain.com...

name:            psql1
service:         a9s-postgresql94
bound apps:
tags:
plan:            postgresql-replica-small
description:     Dedicated a9s PostgreSQL service instances and clusters powered by the anynines Service Framework
documentation:
dashboard:       https://a9s-postgresql-dashboard.de.a9s.eu/service-instances/271ceaa0-eded-43ba-a305-aaecab326079

[...]
```

1. Click **Change Backup Settings** in the service instance dashboard to set an encryption password.
  
1. Create a backup using the dashboard and download the backup to your local machine. The filename will be something like `racsd92baee-1522222422893`.

1. Decrypt the backup and write its contents to a file:
```shell
$ cat racsd92baee-1522222422893 | openssl enc -aes256 -d -pass 'pass:mytopsecretpassword' > backup.sql
```

1. Replace the database name of the original instance in the backup with the database name of the other instance:
```shell
$ cat backup.sql | sed -e 's/pcsd85301a/pcsd59c00c/g' > backup.fork.sql
```

1. Create a tunnel to the admin interface of the a9s PostgreSQL instance forked from the original instance.
```shell
$ cf ssh someapp -L 127.0.0.1:15672:racsd92baee.service.dc1.a9ssvc:15672
```

1. Restore the data:
```shell
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U a9s27ae5c9bfee2937a8dc04b1d7d9b9c9690c97704 pcsd59c00c &lt; backup.fork.sql
```
<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You may see error messages during this procedure. The backup contains data that you lack the necessary permissions to restore, but your data will still be restored.</p>
